# Playground for IFC

Developing requirements in the IFC scheme to represent classifications and property sets in different languages. The main goal is, to be able to load and save property sets from IFC to bsDD and back, without loosing any information.

This work is based on IFC 4 ADD1. We have saved a copy of the XSD-File of IFC 4 ADD 1 in this repository to be able to visualize new enhancements in the IFC scheme based on our requirements.
